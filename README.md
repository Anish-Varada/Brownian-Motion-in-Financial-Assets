# Brownian-Motion-in-Financial-Assets
In this repository, various codes are used to model the effectiveness of various Brownian models (GBM, fBM, and GfBM) in modeling financial assets. The code includes Python scripts for estimating essential parameters, such as drift, volatility, and the Hurst exponent, based on historical training data.
